# British Wildlife Centre - companion app

This was a project in collaboration with the BWC for visitors to enjoy. It includes AR aspects and general info pages with interactive map.
<br/>


<br/>

Different categories are placed around the map but at major locations ie Train stations, pubs etc ... there is a major quiz hub. Only those who have successfully earned enough credibility in the quiz world can play these games and rewards are plentiful should they place well on the major quiz hubs.
